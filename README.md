# Bridges-and-Articulation-points 
Tarjan's algorithm for finding bridges and articulation point in an undirected graph

An articulation point (or cut vertex) is defined as a vertex which,
when removed along with associated edges,makes the graph disconnected in other words increases the number of connected components in the graph 


A bridge is defined as an edge which, when removed,makes the graph disconnected .
(or more precisely, increases the number of connected components in the graph)
